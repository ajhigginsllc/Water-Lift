# Water-Lift
Reverse river flow for irrigation using solar energy, evaporation, condensation, and transmission infrastructure (pipes)

27 June 2019

I've had this idea for some time, and have decided to model it to see if it's practical.  I am also using this repository to
a) learn Git
b) learn R and/or Python programming, especially the object-oriented techniques.

The idea is simple - why can't solar power be concentrated in a way that "boils" (evaporates) sea water in a closed 
system that captures the evaporation, and then uses natural cooling (condensation) and gravity to deliver desalinated water 
inland, to otherwise parched land where people (or plants) are trying to live?

The physics, I'm sure, are possible. After all, this is the rainfall cycle we all learned in grade school.  The economics are
obviously the question.  That's what this model is intended to discern: What might work, such that it can be tried out in the 
real world?

(And as of this writing, also in question is the purity / cleanliness of the resulting output stream.)

But the problem of potable water - and getting it where it's needed without adding to global warming - is a fundamental one
if we're going to survive with >7B people on the planet.  There's enough water there, of course, but we just have to get it
to where we live.

If you wish to contribute to this repo, please contact me at andy.higgins@ajhigginsllc.com.  In the meantime, I'm going to start
puttering around with some ideas.

Thanks,
--Andy
